/*  1. Creation of an application context
 * 	2. The ClassPathXmlApplicationContext refers to config file which is relative to a path on ClassPath.
	3. Beans are being created eagerly by default.
		 Note : To create object lazily, use "lazy-init" attribute iin configurations as true. 
	4. Beans are being created as Singleton by default.
		Note : To create Stateful objects use scope as 'prototype'. In services i have mentioned scope as prototype
	5. Prototypes are always on demand. Nothing like eager creation.	
	6. By Default, it calls Default Constructor. If does not exists in Entity class, throws exception. No default constructor found . It is Un-Checked Exception because it is not asking try catch to write.
	7. In frameworks, why there is always Un-Checked EXceptions, as there is always an headache for developers for checked exception to write try catch.
	8. The <constructor-arg> tag decides the constructor to be invoked while creating a bean.
	9. The <value> is for defining initial value while <ref> is for injection.
	10.Order of the bean creation is not customizable, Spring decides it.
